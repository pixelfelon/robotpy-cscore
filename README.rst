robotpy-cscore
==============

These are python bindings for the cscore library, which is a high performance 
library used in the FIRST Robotics competition to serve video to/from robots.
However, the core library is suitable for use in other applications, and is
comparable to something like mjpg-streamer.

This library has only been tested with Python 3, and will not work with
Python 2.7. We do not intend to support using Python 2.7.

This is the Windows port of the robotpy-cscore library. The current release
will work with 64-bit Windows and Python 3.7. Effort has been made to make
building for other configurations painless, but the process to do so is not
currently documented or supported.
